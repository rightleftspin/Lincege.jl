These are pruning functions to be used inside step 2 of the algorithm,
these functions will always take in a cluster in some form and return
a hash of the cluster and the cluster itself. In some cases, the
function may edit the cluster, and return this edited version.

"""
Takes a cluster and finds the translationally invariant
form of it. This does not rearrange the cluster.

Inputs: 
      cluster: takes the cluster with edge weights based on
      the direction of the bond. Cluster should be of the form
      {
      vertex: [edge_weight, edge_weight, ...],
      next_vertex: ...
      }

Output:
      Tuple of cluster hash and cluster

Finds the canonical ordering of the cluster using Nauty, this
function rearranges the cluster according to the permutation
used by Nauty

Inputs: 
      cluster: takes the cluster in the form of a weighted
      edge list and an array of vertex colors. For example,
      the graph below represents a three vertex graph in
      which edges (1,2) and (1,3) have weight 1 and edge
      (2,3) has weight 2. Vertices 1 and 2 have color 1 and
      vertex 3 has color 2.
