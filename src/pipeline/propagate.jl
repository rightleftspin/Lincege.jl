"""
This is step three of the pipeline. In this step, the algorithm takes in an array of clusters and a pruning function. Using this information, the algorithm will grow subclusters of the clusters by treating the clusters as the 'underlying cluster' in the grow step. It will then take these subclusters and prune them according to the pruning function. Lastly, it will collect the clusters into a hashmap containing the input clusters and a list of all their 
corresponding subclusters.

Main function in this connection. Takes clusters and finds all possible

      subclusters, needs to return a hash of the subcluster and
