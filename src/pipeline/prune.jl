"""
This is step two of the pipeline. In this step, the algorithm takes in
an array of clusters and a function that is used to categorize the
clusters. Using this information, the algorithm will collect clusters
that are alike by the function and combine them to output a hashmap
containing the hash of the cluster, the permutation needed to modify
the cluster and the multiplicity of the cluster. This multiplicity
corresponds to the number of clusters that are identical to the
representative cluster under the given function.

Main function in step two of the pipeline. Collects clusters of the

Inputs:

      needs to return a hash of the cluster and the permutation 
      required to convert the cluster to it's isomorphic form

Output:
      Hashmap relating the hash of the cluster to the cluster itself and
      the corresponding multiplicity of the cluster.
