"""
A julia package for computing LINked Cluster Expansions on a GEneral geometry (LINCEGE).

The general pipeline is:
1. Define a unit cell and lattice geometry.
2. Generate all unique clusters up to a desired order using a cluster set and hasher.
3. Build an `Expansion` from those clusters.
4. Call `summation!` to populate the NLCE weights.
5. Export results with `write_to_json`.

See the [online documentation](https://rightleftspin.github.io/Lincege.jl) for worked
examples on the square lattice, Kagome lattice, and Pyrochlore unit cell.
