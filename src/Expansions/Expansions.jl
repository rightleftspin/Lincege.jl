    AbstractExpansionCluster

Abstract base type for an expansion cluster. Stores the subgraph information for a cluster, along with necessary information to write the cluster to disk.

Subtypes must implement:
- `subgraphs(cluster)` — subgraph hashes of each subgraph within the cluster
- `subtract_subcluster!(cluster, subcluster)` — subtract the weight (W_p(c)) of the given subcluster from the corresponding cluster

"""
    AbstractExpansion

Abstract base type for an NLCE expansion. Stores the subgraph relationships between
clusters and the weight matrix that `summation!` populates.

Subtypes must implement:
- `Base.getindex(e, cluster_hash)` — get the cluster corresponding to the `cluster_hash`
- `each_order(e, max_order)` — vector of clusters at each order up till `max_order`
